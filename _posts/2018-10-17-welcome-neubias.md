Hi all!

This is the very first post on our NeuBIAS blog: Welcome!!!

This is a blog focused on image analysis build by the community for the community.
Here we can share the last updates on image analysis, including papers, tools, analysis pipelines and more! Each post will have a comment section so we can keep the community interactive!

<!-- more -->

We already have a list of topics in mind:
- Recent paper with interesting bioimage analysis
- A plugin / package / add-ons that you want to share
- What I think as the problem in bioimage analyst career; career opportunities
- An image analysis/processing algorithm
- Conference report
- Report about specific NEUBIAS activity

These are just few of many topics you could write about. We need you!




## Why have another communication channel?

NEUBIAS (Network of Europian Bio Image Analysists) has already a central communication channel, that is the [Neubias official website][neubias-website].

- about a recent paper with interesting bioimage analysis
- my favorite plugin / package / add-ons
- What I think as the problem in bioimage analyst career
- my favorite algorithm
- a conference report
- a report about specific NEUBIAS activity
