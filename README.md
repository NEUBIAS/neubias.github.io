Reserved for the NeuBIAS Blog


# Note

For all those who want to help:

- This blog will be built on Jekyll with automated integration via Travis-CI (unless better options appear)
With that strategy, developers and contributors will have independed access and should be straight forward for ANYONE to contribute with minimal effort. A tutorial will be presented.

- For the developers, I will implement Dev routines with automatic build/deploy for making dev as painless as possible. I use Gulp in my personal projects and works great! **You do NOT have to build the website locally. A push is sufficient to trigger the build.**

- Templates for blog posts will be available.

- Please wait before pushing contributions to this repository. Contact [Victor Caldas](mailto:caldas.victor@gmail.com)

- Suggestions and feedback are welcome.

- Requests and bug report should be made via [Github Issues](https://github.com/NeuBIAS/neubias.github.io/issues)

Thanks!
Victor
