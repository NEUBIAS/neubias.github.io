# Note

For all those who want to help:

- This blog will be built on Jekyll with automated integration via Travis-CI (unless better options appear)
With that strategy, developers and contributors will have independed access and should be straight forward for ANYONE to contribute with minimal effort. A tutorial will be presented.

- Please wait before pushing contributions to this repository. Contact [Victor Caldas](mailto:caldas.victor@gmail.com)

- Suggestions and feedback are welcome.

- Requests and bug report should be made via [Github Issues](https://github.com/NeuBIAS/neubias.github.io/issues)

Thanks!
Victor
